# Filtre-Sobel
**Edge Detection with Sobel Filter**   Edge detection identifies points with sharp intensity changes, highlighting object boundaries. The Sobel filter computes image gradients in horizontal and vertical directions, detecting edges effectively. This project includes a sequential C implementation, OpenMP optimization, and performance evaluation.
